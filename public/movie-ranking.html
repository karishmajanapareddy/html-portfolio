<h1>The Best Movies According To Karishma</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies that in 2023</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Transformers: Rise of the beasts</h3>
<p>
    One of the best things about the Transformers series is the incredible machines on display, including the cars, helicopters and trucks that transform into robots. The visual effects teams who help create these movies are experts at twisting and turning hunks of metal into characters</p>

<h3>Spider-man: Across the spider-verse</h3>
<p>
    “Across the Spider-Verse” is a chaotically charming conglomeration of Spider-people, representing all different walks of life. Additionally, it's visually spectacular, showcasing gorgeous cinematography for an animated film and an unfathomable amount of detail in every frame of its masterfully crafted animation.</p>
<p>It is a reminder that we are not on our own and that we need each other; we are stronger together. It reminds us of the importance of connection, relationships and asking for help</p>


<h3>Guardians of galaxy vol.3</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most defining trait of GotG, and one of the most critical reasons why it should be considered the best MCU movie, is its masterful use of comedy. With James Gunn at the helm of this movie, the good times and good jokes were practically guaranteed.</p>
