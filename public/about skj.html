<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I am here to say few things about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.<br />
  Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>

<p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, this is what i love the most because i do it more, I am a great listener. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p> 
<p>I like to look at the clouds in the sky an have a peaceful night with hummings that the birds sing. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn. I used to like snow in winter for few years, but then when i started to live in snow for more than 4 years, thtas when i started disliking it, though we can so much fun with skiing,snowboarding etc.,we have disadvantages too. 
<p></p> I like to be surrounded by people. I like food. I like good books and romantic movies. I like to be around trees(nature). And, I like to laugh and enjoy my life.</p>


This is a brief introduction of myself. I hope you felt good knowing about me.
